# C++ Resources
A collection of resources useful for learning C++

## [en.cppreference.com](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp)

Hands down the best C++ reference next to the standard itself

## [isocpp.org's FAQ](https://isocpp.org/faq)

Answers a lot of very specific questions about the C++ language.

## [www.learncpp.com's C++ Tutorial](http://www.learncpp.com/)

One of the best C++ tutorials out there.
Teaches C++11 techniques right from the start.

## [www.cprogramming.com's C++ Tutorial](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c++-tutorial.html)

A decent C++ tutorial from a website with a number of good articles.  
Although some of their advice is outdated or flawed,  
so take some of the advice with a grain of salt (particularly their explanation of `inline`).  
The newer articles about C++11 features are very good though.  

## [Cpp Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/README.md)

An excellent guide on how to write good C++ code, with input from Bjarne Stroustrup (creator of C++) and Herb Sutter (world-renowned C++ expert).

There's [a version specifically formatted for web browsing](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) if you prefer that to markdown documents.

## [Bjarne Stroustrup's FAQ](http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html)

The musings of C++'s creator.

## [Bjarne Stroustrup's C++11 FAQ](http://www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html)

The musings of C++'s creator about C++11.

## [Bjarne Stroustrup's 2012 Keynote Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iWb_qi2-uI)

A talk given by Bjarne Stroustrup in 2012 discussing C++11 and good C++ style.

# Author's Pick

A collection of very specific articles that I find to be particularly englightening.

## Specific C++ Features

* [`const` correctness and other things you want to know about `const`](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/const-correctness)
