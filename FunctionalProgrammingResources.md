# Functional Programming Resources

A collection of resources useful for learning functional programming

## [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

By far the best introduction to Haskell.  
The simple explanations and smiley doodles make the experience much less painful.  
(Though it does little to dissuade the rumours that all Haskell programmers get their skill by ingesting psilocybin mushrooms.)

## [Functors, Applicatives, and Monads in Pictures](http://www.mokacoding.com/blog/functor-applicative-monads-in-pictures/)

Aimed at Swift, but also applies to Haskell and other functional languages.  
Lots of excellent images illustrating the concepts.  
Images are severely underappreciated in programming - it doesn't have to all be text.

## [Parser Combinators: Parsing for Haskell Beginners](https://two-wrongs.com/parser-combinators-parsing-for-haskell-beginners.html)

A very easy introduction to parser combinators, with a comparison to an equivalent regex.
