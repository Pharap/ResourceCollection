# Programming Resources
A collection of resources useful for learning programming

## Philosophy

### [Hobbits would make good programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G49RUPv5-NU)

A talk by [Larry Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall) about the kinds of qualities a programmer should have, and why Hobbits would make good programmers.

### [What I tell all new programmers](https://josephg.com/blog/what-i-tell-all-new-programmers/)

An interesting blog post providing advice to new programmers.  

## Advice

### [How to Program](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/how-to/program)

Advice about how to tackle programming problems.  
Beginners should read this and take it to heart.  
Experienced programmers should find themselves nodding along in agreement.  

### [27 Things I Wish I'd Known When I Started Programming](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/02/03/twenty-seven-things-i-wish-id-known-when-i-started-programming/)

Normally I'm against numbered list articles because they're typically heinous clickbait,  
but I found myself agreeing with these items, so I've approved it.  

## Skills & General Knowledge

### [Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal](http://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal.html)

Binary and hexadecimal explained simply.

### [How to count to 1000 on two hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SMmc9gQmHQ)

A Youtube video by '3Blue1Brown' demonstrating how knowledge of binary can allow you to count to 1023 (2<sup>10</sup>-1) using two hands.

The piano music is pretty annoying, you might want to mute the video while watching.

Counting in binary on your hands is actually pretty difficult, this is here just to demonstrate that it's possible and to get you thinking about binary and its uses, I'm not suggesting that this is something you ought to be able to do.

### [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

One of the most common types of versioning systems.  

### [Character Encodings](http://kunststube.net/encoding/)

An interesting article about unicode and character encodings.

### [Big O Notation Explained](https://justin.abrah.ms/computer-science/big-o-notation-explained.html)

An interesting article about 'big O notation'.

Justin Abrahms is something of a man after my own heart:
> Big-O notation used to be a really scary concept for me. I thought
this is how "real" programmers talked about their code. It was all the
more scary because the academic descriptions (such as Wikipedia) made
very little sense to me. This is frustrating because the underlying
concepts aren't actually that hard.

### [Big O Notation](http://cooervo.github.io/Algorithms-DataStructures-BigONotation/big-O-notation.html)

Another 'big O notation' article with diagrams.

## Design Principles

### [Separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)

## Techniques

### [Interpolation methods](http://paulbourke.net/miscellaneous/interpolation/)

A discussion of various interpolation methods by **Paul Bourke**.  
Interpolation functions are an incredbily useful tool in any programmer's toolkit.  
They can be used to transform discrete data into continuous data in a variety of ways.

### [Collision Detection](https://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/)

An online book discussing how to implement various different kinds of collision detection, by **Jeff Thompson**.  
Covers both the more comon kinds of collision and some more obscure kinds.

## Data Structures

### [Circular Buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)

A kind of fixed-sized queue commonly used when memory is severely constrained.

## Random Number Generation

### [Modulo Bias](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10984974/why-do-people-say-there-is-modulo-bias-when-using-a-random-number-generator)

## Obscure Data Structures

These data structures are particularly obscure. You aren't likely to need to know about them, but I'm listing them here because they're interesting and have some particularly niche applications.

### [Zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper_(data_structure))

A data structure used for traversing sequences that's popular in purely functional languages.

### [Piece Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table)

Represents a series of edits performed on a text document.

### [Rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure))

### [Gap Buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_buffer)

### [Unrolled Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrolled_linked_list)
